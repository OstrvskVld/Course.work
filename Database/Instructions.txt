# User Instructions for the Program

1. **Data Entry**:
   - Do not enter **int** values where a **string** is required. For example, when entering a vehicle's license plate, use letters and numbers.
   - Avoid spaces in fields that do not allow spaces (e.g., license plates).
   - If the program asks for input data (e.g., vehicle model), enter it without extra characters or spaces.

2. **Menu Operations**:
   - When selecting an option in the menu (A, B, C, etc.), ensure that you enter only one character that corresponds to your choice.
   - Capitalize first words in all string values!
   - Enter all string values without spaces! If there are several words, use “_”.
   - If you enter an invalid character, the program will display an error message and prompt you to try again.

3. **Admin Password**:
   - To access administrative functions, you must enter the correct password. Currently, the password is "123".
   - If you enter an incorrect password, the program will display an error message and allow you to retry.

4. **Exiting the Program**:
   - You can exit the program at any time by entering the character **Q**. The program will confirm the exit.

5. **Additional Recommendations**:
